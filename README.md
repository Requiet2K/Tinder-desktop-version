# Tinder Desktop App

## Overview

This is a desktop version of Tinder that I developed in 2021. The application stores user data in a MySQL database. Similar to Tinder, users can like each other, leading to a match. Users have the option to select their preferred region and gender to view potential matches in that area. Once matched, users can engage in real-time chat with each other.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing
- Advanced SQL
- MySQL Database

## Features

- **User Authentication:**
  The app uses MySQL to securely store user data, including login credentials.

- **Matching System:**
  Users can like or skip profiles, and if two users like each other, it results in a match.

- **Location-based Filtering:**
  Users can set their preferred region, and the app displays potential matches based on this preference.

- **Real-time Chat:**
  Matched users can engage in real-time chat with each other within the application.
